# Basic Full Stack Docker Implementation

This Docker full stack is made of binding together a Next.js as Client and Apollo Server for Data. First, this system will show data from an external endpoint. Finally, the external endpoint will be replaced by a MongoDB endpoint.

This project use Docker Compose, which bind together front and back end. The project is built from a root folder to placed the rest into it. The root folder will include a docker-compose.yml file, then, fron and back end will include a Dockerfile file within.

1. Must Know: The projects runs from root, where the docker-compose.yml is.
2. create root folder
      1. create docker-compose.yml
3. create back end folder (Express)
      1. create Dockerfile
4. create front end folder
      1. create Dockerfile
